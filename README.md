# 5. How many ways can you run Javascript in your HTML? explain briefly
You can use inline script tags, external script files, event handlers, and dom manipulation.
* Inline script tags are when you add JavaScript in your HTML file.

* Event handlers are to run JavaScript lines of code as a result of a user's choice of action.
* DOM manipulation is when you use the JavaScript with the HTML file after its loaded.
